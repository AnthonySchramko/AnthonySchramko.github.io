# AnthonySchramko Portfolio

### This is my web-portfolio's repository page. On this portfolio, you will find information about me, my development with the technology and any projects I have worked on.

## Purpose

### The purpose of this portfolio was to show off my web-developer skills and other projects to all. This webpage demonstrates my developing knowledge of HTML and SCSS.

## Process

### I went about this project in small batches, breaking down the bigger problem and making it easier on myself. At first, I made the general layout of my HTML webpage, then worked on generic scss mixins/breakpoints that I knew I would use throughout the project. After this, I would make branches and work on specific sections at a time, any scss required and the HTML behind it. Towards the end, I spent more time making my SCSS look a bit better, website palettes and fixing any problems with differing screen sizes.

## Review

### I feel like my frontend work could use a bit more, but overall I feel like I tackled this project well. Most of this was new to me, so learning a lot and applying what was taught was fun/interesting. As I progressed down the project, it made me realise more and more about what I was doing and everything was becoming more purposeful instead of forceful.
